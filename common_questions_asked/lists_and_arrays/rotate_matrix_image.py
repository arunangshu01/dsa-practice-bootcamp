Rotate Matrix / Image - LeetCode 48

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.

DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example:
    Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
